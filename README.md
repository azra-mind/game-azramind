To Play the game:

This is a command-line game written in Python with a backend and API written in Python/Flask

I taught myself how to build a backend in Python/Flask in 3 days to write this program in an Object Oriented Language. 

* Clone the master branch of the repo onto your machine.
* From the terminal, cd into the root directory of the repo.
* The game is written in Python version 3.7.4 so you need Python 3 installed.
* You also need the pip package manager, which is included in Python 2 >=2.7.9 or Python 3 >=3.4
* If you need to install pip, you can do so here: https://pypi.org/project/pip
* Once you have PIP, please run this command from the root folder: pip3 -r install requirements.txt
* After you've installed the requirements. You are ready to play the game!
* Enter the following prompt to start playing the game: python3 game-logic.py
